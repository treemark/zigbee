## 🎮 How to Control Your Device

### Method 1: Interactive Script (Easiest)
```bash
./control_openbeken_device.sh
```
This script provides an interactive menu to control your device with options to turn it on/off, toggle, and check status.

### Method 2: Direct HTTP Commands
```bash
# Turn on
curl "http://192.168.86.66/cm?cmnd=POWER1%201"

# Turn off
curl "http://192.168.86.66/cm?cmnd=POWER1%200"

# Toggle
curl "http://192.168.86.66/cm?cmnd=POWER1%202"
```

### Method 3: MQTT Commands
```bash
# Turn on (if mosquitto-clients installed)
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1883 -t 'cmnd/obk17811957/POWER1' -m '1'

# Turn off
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1883 -t 'cmnd/obk17811957/POWER1' -m '0'
```

### Method 4: Web Interface
Open in your browser: **http://192.168.86.66/**

## ⚙️ Important Next Step: Configure Device Pins

Your device currently shows **"0 drivers active"**, which means the physical pins haven't been configured yet. To make the device actually control something (lights, relays, etc.):

1. **Access Configuration Page**:
   ```
   http://192.168.86.66/cfg
   ```

2. **Click "Configure Module"**

3. **Select Device Template** or **Manually Configure Pins**:
   - Choose a pre-configured template if your device matches a known model
   - Or manually assign pin roles (Relay, PWM, Button, etc.)

4. **Common Pin Configurations**:
   - **Relay/Switch**: Set pin as "Rel" (Relay)
   - **LED/Light**: Set pins as "PWM" for dimmable control
   - **Button**: Set pin as "Btn" for physical button input

5. **Save and Restart** the device

Once pins are configured, your POWER commands will control the actual physical outputs!

# Start again:
./gradlew :philips:bootRun
```

## 🚀 Advanced Usage

### Monitor MQTT Messages
If you have `mosquitto-clients` installed:
```bash
# Monitor all device messages
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -p 1883 -t 'obk17811957/#' -v

# Monitor all messages
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -p 1883 -t '#' -v
```

### Custom Commands
OpenBeken supports many commands. Send them via HTTP:
```bash
# Get help
curl "http://192.168.86.66/cm?cmnd=help"

# Check status
curl "http://192.168.86.66/cm?cmnd=status"

# Restart device
curl "http://192.168.86.66/cm?cmnd=restart"
```

### Integration with Home Automation
Once your device pins are configured and working:
- The device will publish state changes to MQTT automatically
- You can integrate with Home Assistant, Node-RED, or other platforms
- Subscribe to topics: `obk17811957/+/get` for state updates

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Device Not Responding
```bash
# Check if device is reachable
ping 192.168.86.66

# Check web interface
curl http://192.168.86.66/
```

### MQTT Connection Issues
```bash
# Verify MQTT broker is running
nc -zv 192.168.1.5 1883

# Check application logs
tail -f /tmp/philips_app.log | grep -i mqtt
```

### Device Shows "disconnected"
1. Restart the application (which runs the MQTT broker)
2. Wait 10-15 seconds for device to reconnect
3. Check logs for connection errors

## 📝 Notes

- **No Physical Control Yet**: The device is configured and connected, but you need to configure the pin assignments (step above) before it can control physical devices
- **MQTT Topics**: OpenBeken uses `cmnd/` prefix for commands and publishes to `obk17811957/` topics
- **Application Design**: The current application is primarily designed for Zigbee2MQTT devices, but works with OpenBeken via the embedded MQTT broker
- **Direct Control Recommended**: For OpenBeken devices, direct HTTP or MQTT commands work best until the application is extended to support OpenBeken's topic structure
